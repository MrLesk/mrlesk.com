* Backlog.md allows developers to have 3 review checkpoints:
  1. Review the Task Description and Acceptance Criteria
  2. Review the Implementation Plan
  3. Review the Code and check the results
* For UI tasks, human review is even more important
* If the result is not good enough, you can adjust the task and try again
