# Why markdown tasks work so well with AI Agents?

<v-clicks>

* Agents can easily read markdown files → it's just text
* Tasks act as persistent context → allow better context engineering
* Scope is well defined → Claude is less likely to implement features outside of scope
* Can easily switch between models for different tasks
* Can work on multiple tasks in parallel using Git Worktrees
