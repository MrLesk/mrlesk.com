<v-clicks>

* Models degrade in quality the more their context window is used
* Anthropic and OpenAI recommend to avoid compaction and start fresh with each task
* Backlog.md allows you to do this easily â†’ One task, one context window, one PR
* If you split tasks correctly (this is the hardest part), you won't need information from other tasks
