# What is Istoria?

<div v-click>

#### It's an app that helps you write stories using only your voice

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-10">

## How does it work?

</div>

<v-clicks class="mt-4">

* It uses a local LLM model to transcribe your voice into text
* LLM will understand if we are sending a command or a story content
* Can understand if we are talking about a new story or an existing one
* Can change content without touching the keyboard

</v-clicks>

<card v-click icon="ðŸ’¡" class="mt-6" title="NOTE" >
Istoria is going to take more than 30 minutes to be built. <br>
But it's a realistic example of what you can do with Backlog.md.
