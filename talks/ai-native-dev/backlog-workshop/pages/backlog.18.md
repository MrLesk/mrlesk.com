# What to not expect from Backlog.md?

<v-clicks>

* A command center for creating and delegating tasks to AI Agents → _Check Conductor/Vibe Kanban_
* An hosted SaaS to where you can log in and manage tasks like Jira/Linear → _Backlog.md is offline only_
* Multi-repo support → _You need to initialize Backlog.md in each repo_
* Documents and Decisions features → they work... kinda → _Will spend more time on those soon_
* Integration with Github Issues, Jira, Linear → not in the focus for now → _Try to use their MCP servers instead_
* Production grade support → _I'm doing my best with the little free time I have, but you are free to submit PRs_ ☺️
