Successful approaches ensure that Agents can test and verify their own changes:

- **Basic checks**: Instruct Agents to run type checks, formatting, linting, and builds
- **Test Output**: Enable AI-friendly Unit/Integration test output
- **Self-Review**: Ask Agents to review their own code (e.g. `codex /review`)
- **Visual Verification**: Use tools like Chrome DevTools MCP to verify the web interface
- **Definition of Done**: Ask Agents to verify the code against the DoD
- **Compound learning**: Refine your skills and AGENTS.md instructions when facing obstacles
