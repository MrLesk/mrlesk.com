# Warmup

<v-clicks>

* Markdown tasks allow better context engineering with Backlog structure, AI Agents won’t run out of context window
* Can easily rollback single tasks, improve the specs and try again
* Scope is well defined by acceptance criteria. Agents will not do less or more features than requested.
* Allows 3 step review process: after task creation, after implementation plan and after execution
* Can work on multiple tasks in parallel if there are no dependencies
