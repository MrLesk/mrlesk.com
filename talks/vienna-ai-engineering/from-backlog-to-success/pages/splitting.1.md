# Ask AI to do it

Here is the prompt we hand to `codex --yolo --search`:

```markdown
Given the @prd.md file,
create relevant tasks and subtasks using backlog CLI tool.

Tasks should follow the task guidelines.

Think hard how each task can implement the
definition of done in a meaningful way.

Also, I want to see tests and and type checks as early as possible.

```
