# Ask AI to do it

Here is the prompt we hand to <PromptChip>codex --yolo --search</PromptChip>

```markdown
Read and understand all tasks in "To Do".

Think hard about how to implement them in a meaningful way.

You can search on internet the technologies that we are using
to ensure that you know how to use their latest versions.

Afterwards write in each task the appropriate
implementation plan according to the guidelines.
