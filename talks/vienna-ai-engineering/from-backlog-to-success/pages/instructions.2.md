# Instructions Backlog.md: Comprehensive Project Management Tool via CLI

### Assistant Objective

Efficiently manage all project tasks, status, and documentation using the Backlog.md CLI, ensuring all project metadata
remains fully synchronized and up-to-date.

### Core Capabilities

- ✅ **Task Management**: Create, edit, assign, prioritize, and track tasks with full metadata
- ✅ **Search**: Fuzzy search across tasks, documents, and decisions with `backlog search`
- ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**: Granular control with add/remove/check/uncheck by index
- ✅ **Board Visualization**: Terminal-based Kanban board (`backlog board`) and web UI (`backlog browser`)
- ✅ **Git Integration**: Automatic tracking of task states across branches
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Task relationships and subtask hierarchies
- ✅ **Documentation & Decisions**: Structured docs and architectural decision records
- ✅ **Export & Reporting**: Generate markdown reports and board snapshots
- ✅ **AI-Optimized**: `--plain` flag provides clean text output for AI processing

### Why This Matters to You (AI Agent)

1. **Comprehensive system** - Full project management capabilities through CLI
2. **The CLI is the interface** - All operations go through `backlog` commands
3. **Unified interaction model** - You can use CLI for both reading (`backlog task 1 --plain`) and writing (
   `backlog task edit 1`)
4. **Metadata stays synchronized** - The CLI handles all the complex relationships
