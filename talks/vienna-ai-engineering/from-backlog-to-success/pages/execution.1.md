# Ask AI to do it

Here is the prompt we hand to `codex --yolo --search`:

```markdown
Read all tasks of this project and understand what is the scope.
For each task look at the implementation plan and follow it step by step.

Implement all tasks and ensure the acceptance criteria and the goals are met.

At the end of each task, write the implementation notes and the definition of done.

```
