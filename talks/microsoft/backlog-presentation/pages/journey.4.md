# How can we make the process more repeatable?

<v-clicks>

* With a pre-defined structure: **why** (description), **what** (acceptance criteria), **how** (plan)
* In a format that both humans and agents could easily understand: **markdown files**
* Checked-in in the **git repository** so that agents can easily read them
* Instruct agents (via AGENTS.md) about our workflow
