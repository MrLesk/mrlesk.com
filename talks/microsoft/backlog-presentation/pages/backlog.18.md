# What not to expect from Backlog.md?

<v-clicks>

* A command center for creating and delegating tasks to AI agents → _Check Conductor/Vibe Kanban_
* A hosted SaaS where you can log in and manage tasks like Jira/Linear → _Backlog.md is Git-based_
* Multi-repo support → _Not yet; you need to initialize Backlog.md in each repo_
* Documents and Decisions features → they work... kind of → _I'll spend more time on those soon_
* Integration with GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear → not the focus for now → _But you can reference them_
* Production-grade support → _I work on Backlog.md in my free time, but you are free to submit PRs_ ☺️
