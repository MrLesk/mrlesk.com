# Why does this approach work so well?

<v-clicks>

* Agents can easily read Markdown files → _it's just text_
* Tasks act as persistent context → _allows better context engineering_
* Scope is well-defined → _Agents are less likely to implement features outside of scope_
* You can easily switch between models for different tasks
* You can work on multiple tasks in parallel using Git Worktrees
