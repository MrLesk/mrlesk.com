The landscape of AI coding tools is exploding. We evolved quickly from simple autocomplete to the GitHub Copilot era, and now we face a new wave of Agentic CLI tools, protocols like MCP, ACP and A2A, and frameworks like ADK. It moves so fast that catching up feels impossible.

This talk aims to ground us. I will guide you through this explosion of tools, separating the hype from the reality. We will focus on practical applications and identify the specific tools that actually help us ship real software right now.
