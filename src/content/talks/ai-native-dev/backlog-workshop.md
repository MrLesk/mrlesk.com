In this workshop, we explore the 'Spec-driven AI Development' methodology. We'll see how defining tasks in Markdown with clear Acceptance Criteria and Implementation Plans allows AI agents to work reliably. Participants will get hands-on experience initializing Backlog.md, creating tasks, and guiding agents through the 3-way review process (Spec, Plan, Code) to achieve a high success rate.
