Developing with AI agents like Claude, Codex, or Cursor can quickly turn into a troubleshooting loop. This talk shows how Backlog.md brings structure back to AI-assisted development with smaller, reviewable tasks and a repeatable spec-driven delivery flow.

We walk through the full loop in practice: define tasks, execute with agents, and review outcomes with confidence. The goal is to make AI-assisted feature delivery more deterministic, predictable, and easier to scale.
